#Food Delivery Time Prediction MLOps Project

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict food delivery times accurately for food delivery services like Zomato and Swiggy. The system calculates delivery times based on historical data and the distance between the restaurant and delivery locations.

Problem Statement

Food delivery services require accurate time predictions to maintain transparency with customers. This project addresses the challenge by using machine learning to predict delivery times in real-time based on historical data and distance calculations.
